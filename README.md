# The Last Eclipse

**A countdown timer to the end of our Sun, marking the moment it becomes a red giant.**

This project is the culmination of a heartfelt request from my child, who wanted to see a countdown to the day our Sun becomes a red giant. It is more than a simple coding exercise; it is a shared dream between a father and his child, created line by line, laugh by laugh. This timer is our way of giving shape to the unimaginable, and to show that even the end of something as grand as the Sun can be beautiful.

## Features
- **Epic Countdown**: A visual countdown showing the years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the Sun becomes a red giant.
- **Meaningful Collaboration**: Developed together with my child, making this project a deeply personal and cherished experience.
- **Timelessness**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is intended to live on, replicated across servers as a testament to love and wonder.

Feel free to fork or modify this project for non-commercial purposes. The code is simple and might contain some imperfections, but it captures the essence of our journey together. The countdown is, of course, approximate, but that was never the point. The point was the love we put into it.
